# Chat Room — React Native (Expo) front end

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) front end for the
`chat-room` example, built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/). It talks to
the same Reboot backend as the `frontend/web/` front end and demonstrates that
the Reboot React client (`@reboot-dev/reboot-react`) runs in React
Native — on iOS, Android, and the web — in addition to the browser.

The UI is the browser example ported to React Native primitives
(`View`, `Text`, `TextInput`, `Pressable`, `FlatList`); the Reboot
integration (`RebootClientProvider`, the generated `useChatRoom` hook,
reactive `useMessages`, and optimistic `send`) is identical to `frontend/web/`.

## React Native compatibility

React Native does not provide every web API the Reboot client relies
on. This example covers the gaps as follows:

- **`crypto.getRandomValues`** (used by the `uuid` package for
  idempotency keys) is polyfilled by importing
  [`react-native-get-random-values`](https://github.com/LinusU/react-native-get-random-values)
  at the very top of `index.js`, before any Reboot code loads. On the
  web this import is a no-op because the browser already has Web
  Crypto.
- **Streaming `fetch` responses** (used by Reboot's reactive readers)
  work because Expo SDK 52+ installs the WinterCG-compliant
  [`expo/fetch`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/expo/#expofetch)
  as the global `fetch` on native, which supports
  `response.body.getReader()`.

The remaining gaps are handled inside the Reboot framework itself, so
apps don't need to patch the client.

## Run it

### 1. Start the backend

From the `chat-room` directory, exactly as for the `frontend/web/` front end
(see the top-level [`README.md`](../../README.md)):

```sh
rbt dev run
```

That generates the Reboot client code and serves the application. It
prints `http://127.0.0.1:9991`, but it actually binds to all
interfaces, so it is also reachable from a simulator and from a phone
on the same network at your machine's LAN IP.

### 2. Build the front end

From this directory:

```sh
npm install
```

Step 1's `rbt dev run` already generates the typed Reboot client into
`frontend/api/`, shared with the web app (the example's top-level
`.rbtrc` configures this via `generate --react=frontend/api`), so
`npm install` is all you need here. To regenerate the clients on
their own, run `rbt generate` from
the `chat-room` directory.

### 3. Run it

#### Browser (react-native-web)

```sh
npm run web
```

#### iOS simulator

```sh
npm run ios
```

The default backend URL (`http://localhost:9991`) works from the
simulator, so no extra configuration is needed. The first launch
downloads and installs Expo Go into the simulator; if that initial
auto-open times out (it can, right after the install), just run
`npm run ios` again — Expo Go is now installed — or open the app
manually:

```sh
xcrun simctl openurl booted exp://127.0.0.1:8081
```

#### Physical device (iOS or Android)

A phone can't reach `localhost`, so point the app at your machine's LAN
IP (and make sure the phone is on the same Wi-Fi). `npm start` runs an
interactive Metro that prints a scannable QR code:

```sh
# Find your LAN IP (macOS): ipconfig getifaddr en0
EXPO_PUBLIC_REBOOT_URL=http://192.168.1.42:9991 npm start
```

Open the project in [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on the phone by
scanning that QR — with the iOS Camera app (tap "Open in Expo Go") or
with Expo Go's own "Scan QR code". Note that Expo Go's "Development
servers" list relies on local-network discovery and may stay empty
even when everything is reachable; scanning the QR sidesteps it.

### Pointing at the backend

The app reads its server URL from the `EXPO_PUBLIC_REBOOT_URL`
environment variable, falling back to `http://localhost:9991`. Set it
to whatever the target can actually reach:

| Target              | `EXPO_PUBLIC_REBOOT_URL`    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Browser / iOS sim   | (unset — `localhost` works) |
| Physical device     | `http://<your-LAN-IP>:9991` |
