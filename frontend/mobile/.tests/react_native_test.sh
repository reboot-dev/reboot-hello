# Builds the React Native (Expo) front end of the `chat-room` example
# end-to-end: it generates the typed Reboot clients from the example's
# own top-level `.rbtrc` using the `rbt` CLI, installs the mobile app's
# JavaScript dependencies overlaid with the locally built Reboot npm
# packages, and type-checks the app against the generated mobile
# client. This guards that the `@reboot-dev/reboot-react`/
# `@reboot-dev/reboot-web` client keeps building and type-checking under
# React Native's toolchain. The runtime React Native API compatibility
# itself is covered by the Maestro end-to-end test, `maestro_test.sh`.
