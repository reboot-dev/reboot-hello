# Native end-to-end test for the chat-room mobile app. Unlike
# `react_native_test.sh` (which only generates + type-checks), this
# runs the REAL app on a real Android runtime (Hermes) and drives a
# real user flow against a real Reboot backend, using Maestro:
#
#   backend (rbt dev run, :9991) ──┐
#   headless Android emulator ─────┼──> Expo Go loads the app
#   `npx expo start --android`  ───┘     (EXPO_PUBLIC_REBOOT_URL=10.0.2.2:9991)
#   `maestro test .maestro/flow.yaml` drives it and asserts the
#   reactive read + send round-trips render.
#
# Requirements (baked into the devcontainer image's `Dockerfile`):
# a JDK, the Android SDK + emulator + a system image, Maestro, and
# `/dev/kvm` access (the `vscode` user is in the `kvm` group). This is
# intentionally NOT hermetic and is tagged `manual`/`local`/`exclusive`
# in BUILD.bazel: it needs the host's `/dev/kvm` and a single emulator,
# so it can't run on remote executors.

set -e # Exit if a command exits with an error.
set -u # Treat expanding an unset variable as an error.
set -x # Echo executed commands to help debug failures.
