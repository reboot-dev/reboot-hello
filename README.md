# Reboot Hello World

For the impatient:
1. Prepare an environment by either:
    * [Using VSCode connected to a GitHub Codespace](#using-vscode-connected-to-a-github-codespace)
    * [Installing prerequisites directly](#installing-prerequisites-directly)
2. [Run the application](#run-the-application)

### Overview

This repository contains a simple example application written using Reboot.

The [Reboot '.proto' definitions](https://docs.reboot.dev/develop/schema#code-generation)
can be found in the `api/` directory, grouped into
subdirectories by proto package, while backend specific code can be
found in `backend/` and front end specific code in `web/` and non-React front end in `reboot-non-react-web/`.

_For more information on all of the Reboot examples, please [see the docs](https://docs.reboot.dev/get_started/examples)._

### Using VSCode connected to a GitHub Codespace

This method requires running [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your machine: if that isn't your bag, see [the other environment option](#install-prerequisites-directly) below.

This repository includes a [Dev Container config](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) (more about [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/)) that declares all of the dependencies that you need to build and run the example. Dev Containers can be started locally with VSCode, but we recommend using GitHub's [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to quickly launch the Dev Container:

1. Right-click to create a Codespace in a new tab or window:
    * [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/reboot-dev/reboot-hello)
    * *Important*: In order to view the example's front end, you must connect your local VSCode to the codespace: you cannot use VSCode in a browser window.
2. Go to [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) and click the three dots next to the codespace you just created and then click `Open in Visual Studio Code`.
    * You can [set your default editor to VSCode for codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/setting-your-default-editor-for-github-codespaces) to avoid this step in the future. See [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/opening-an-existing-codespace?tool=vscode) for more information.

Now you're ready to [run the application](#run-the-application)!

### Installing prerequisites directly

Running directly on a host requires:

- A platform of either:
   - `x86_64 Linux` with `glibc>=2.31` (Ubuntu Focal and other equivalent-generation Linux distributions)
   - `arm64 or x86_64 MacOS` with `MacOS>=13.0` and `Xcode>=14.3`
- [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) - A tool to manage `python`, `pip`, and `venv`.
   - If you are already familiar with Python [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), feel free to use your tool of choice with [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml). Python >= 3.10 and < 3.13 is required.
- Node.js
    - Including `npm`.
- Docker
    - Note: the example does not run "inside of" Docker, but Docker is used to host a native support service for local development.

If you are unable to meet any of these requirements, we suggest using the [VSCode and Dev Container environment](#using-vscode-connected-to-a-github-codespace) discussed above.

Now you're ready to [run the application](#run-the-application)!

## Run the application

### Backend

Our backend is implemented in Python and we must install its dependencies before
running it. The most notable of those dependencies is the `reboot` PyPI
distribution, which contains both the Reboot CLI (`rbt`) and the `reboot`
Python package.

Using `rye`, we can create and activate a virtualenv containing this project's dependencies (as well as fetch an appropriate Python version) using:
```sh
rye sync --no-lock
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Run the backend

Then, to run the application, you can use the Reboot CLI `rbt` (present in the active virtualenv):
```shell
rbt dev run
```

Running `rbt dev run` will watch for file modifications and restart the
application if necessary. See the `.rbtrc` file for flags and
arguments that get expanded when running `rbt dev run`.

### Front end

Similar to the backend, the front end has dependencies that need to be installed before running it. Open a separate terminal/shell and do:
```shell
cd web/
npm install
npm start
```

If using VSCode, the page will load automatically.
If not using VSCode, visit [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

### Non-React front end

The non-React front end can be run in a similar way to the React front end,
but it uses a different directory and port:

```shell
cd reboot-non-react-web/
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) to view the application.

### Tests

The application comes with backend tests.

Before you run the tests, you'll
need to ensure you've run `rbt generate`.  If you've already run `rbt dev run`
without modifying `.rbtrc`, `rbt generate` will have been run for you as
part of that command.
Otherwise, you can do it manually.

```sh
rbt generate
```

`rbt generate` will automatically make required Reboot '.proto'
dependencies like `rbt/v1alpha1/options.proto` available on the
import path without you having to check them into your own repository.

Now you can run the tests using `pytest`:

```sh
pytest backend/
```
### Running on the Reboot Cloud

This repository contains a `Dockerfile` that makes it possible to run this application on
[the Reboot Cloud](https://cloud.reboot.dev/)! To use the Reboot Cloud you
currently still need an invitation; sign up at https://cloud.reboot.dev/ to be considered.

Once you've received an invitation to use Reboot Cloud, you will also receive an
API key. You can then run this application on Reboot Cloud as follows:

```console
rbt cloud up --api-key=YOUR_API_KEY --name=yourapp
```

To make calls to the application that just started, find the application's URL
in the output of `rbt cloud up`:

```sh
'yourapp' is available at: YOUR_URL
```

Tell the front end to talk to it by updating the `VITE_REBOOT_URL` value in
`web/.env`:

```tsx
VITE_REBOOT_URL=YOUR_URL
```

Then, in the `web/` directory, run `npm run build`.

Once built, this front end can be deployed to any static hosting provider like
S3, Vercel, Cloudflare or Firebase hosting.
