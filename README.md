# Reboot Hello World

For the impatient:
1. Prepare an environment by either:
    * [Using VSCode connected to a GitHub Codespace](#using-vscode-connected-to-a-github-codespace)
    * [Installing prerequisites directly](#installing-prerequisites-directly)
2. [Run the application](#run-the-application)

### Overview

This repository contains a simple example application written using Reboot.

The [Reboot '.proto' definition](https://docs.reboot.dev/develop/schema#code-generation)
can be found in the `api/` directory, grouped into
subdirectories by proto package, while backend specific code can be
found in `backend/` and front end specific code in `web/`.

_For more information on all of the Reboot examples, please [see the docs](https://docs.reboot.dev/get_started/examples)._

### Using VSCode connected to a GitHub Codespace

This method requires running [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your machine: if that isn't your bag, see [the other environment option](#install-prerequisites-directly) below.

This repository includes a [Dev Container config](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) (more about [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/)) that declares all of the dependencies that you need to build and run the example. Dev Containers can be started locally with VSCode, but we recommend using GitHub's [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to quickly launch the Dev Container:

1. Right-click to create a Codespace in a new tab or window:
    * [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/reboot-dev/reboot-hello)
    * *Important*: In order to view the example's front end, you must connect your local VSCode to the codespace: you cannot use VSCode in a browser window.
2. Go to [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) and click the three dots next to the codespace you just created and then click `Open in Visual Studio Code`.
    * You can [set your default editor to VSCode for codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/setting-your-default-editor-for-github-codespaces) to avoid this step in the future. See [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/opening-an-existing-codespace?tool=vscode) for more information.

Now you're ready to [run the application](#run-the-application)!

### Installing prerequisites directly

Running directly on a host requires:

- A platform of either:
   - `x86_64 Linux` with `glibc>=2.31` (Ubuntu Focal and other equivalent-generation Linux distributions)
   - `arm64 or x86_64 MacOS` with `MacOS>=13.0` and `Xcode>=14.3`
- [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) - A tool to manage `python`, `pip`, and `venv`.
   - If you are already familiar with Python [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), feel free to use your tool of choice with [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml). Python >=3.10 is required.
- Node.js
    - Including `npm`.
- Docker
    - Note: the example does not run "inside of" Docker, but Docker is used to host a native support service for local development.

If you are unable to meet any of these requirements, we suggest using the [VSCode and Dev Container environment](#using-vscode-connected-to-a-github-codespace) discussed above.

Now you're ready to [run the application](#run-the-application)!

<a id="run-the-application"></a>
## Run the application

### Backend

Our backend is implemented in Python and we must install its dependencies before
running it. The most notable of those dependencies is the `reboot` PyPI
distribution, which contains both the Reboot CLI (`rbt`) and the `reboot`
Python package.

Using `rye`, we can create and activate a virtualenv containing this project's dependencies (as well as fetch an appropriate Python version) using:
```sh
rye sync --no-lock
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Run the backend

Then, to run the application, you can use the Reboot CLI `rbt` (present in the active virtualenv):
```shell
rbt dev run
```

Running `rbt dev run` will watch for file modifications and restart the
application if necessary. See the `.rbtrc` file for flags and
arguments that get expanded when running `rbt dev run`.

### Front end

Similar to the backend, the front end has dependencies that need to be installed before running it. Open a separate terminal/shell and do:
```shell
cd web/
npm install
npm start
```

If using VSCode, the page will load automatically.
If not using VSCode, visit [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).
### Tests

The application comes with backend tests.

Before you run the tests, you'll
need to ensure you've run `rbt protoc`.  If you've already run `rbt dev run`
without modifying `.rbtrc`, `rbt protoc` will have been run for you as
part of that command.
Otherwise, you can do it manually.

```sh
rbt protoc
```

`rbt protoc` will automatically make required Reboot '.proto'
dependencies like `rbt/v1alpha1/options.proto` available on the
import path without you having to check them into your own repository.

Now you can run the tests using `pytest`:

```sh
pytest backend/
```
### Running on the Reboot Cloud

Pick a public Docker registry you can push images to. Determine the name you'd
like the image to have in that registry. For example:
`ghcr.io/your-github-username/reboot-hello`.

#### Build and push the Docker image like you're used to.

```shell
export IMAGE_NAME=yourregistry.io/yourname/yourproject/yourappname
docker build --tag $IMAGE_NAME .
docker push $IMAGE_NAME
```

#### Launch the image on the Reboot cloud
Include the image's SHA in its name, so that it is unambiguous exactly which version of the image you're choosing.
```sh
export IMAGE_NAME_WITH_SHA=$(docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' $IMAGE_NAME)
rbt cloud up --image-name=$IMAGE_NAME_WITH_SHA --api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Execute that `rbt cloud up` command to have your pushed Reboot container run
on the Reboot Cloud! ðŸŽ‰

To make calls to the application that just started, get the endpoint URL from
message output to the console.

```sh
Application starting; your application will be available at:

<application_id>.prod1.rbt.cloud:9991
```

To build a version of the front end that can talk to the deployed app, update
the `REACT_APP_REBOOT_ENDPOINT` value in `web/.env`:

```tsx
REACT_APP_REBOOT_ENDPOINT=https://<application_id>.prod1.rbt.cloud:9991
```

Then, in the `web/` directory, run `npm run build`.

Once built, this front end can be deployed to any static hosting provider like
S3, Vercel, Cloudflare or Firebase hosting.
